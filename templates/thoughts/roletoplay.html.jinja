Individuals often assume malice or nefarious intent during a perceived conflict of interest when they hear a corporate or government entity state intentions that would exploit the conflict of interest in the entity's favor. This breeds distrust, and distrust leads to breakdown. For navigating this breach of trust, it is important NOT if the corporate actors actually make decisions with respect to the person's best interest, but rather if the person believes that they do. When a perceived conflict of interest is present, without some way to convey an unbiased viewpoint, it can be very difficult to convince the individual that a recommendation is advisable.

There is often a disconnect between what a person believes corporations are obligated to do and what corporations believe they themselves are obligated to do; often, what happens is the person assumes standards they were taught as an individual also apply to the corporate actors. In an ideal world, there would be no difference in the responsibility of corporate and individual practices, but the realities of running a business necessitate shortcuts and quick fixes. In fact, as individuals with disposable income, one could almost argue that it is the corporation's responsibility to generate the surplus and the individual's responsiblity to allocate that surplus according to their values and morals, including patronizing more ethical (and more expensive) businesses.

I think crucial here is the disconnect between what people assume the corporation's role is and what the corporation thinks its role is. People want corporations to adopt more sustainable practices: healthier and more toxin and carcinogen-free products, less environmental destruction, and more eagerness to advocate for and carry though on employee-focused quality-of-life benefits such as wage increases and paid time off. The reality is though, that corporations exist in order to maximize shareholder profits, and any quality-of-life benefits it can give its employees are only possible if justifiable from a profits perspective. The notion of a "public corporation" used to exist a long time ago, but I think most corporate decision-makers are far beyond being able to make those kinds of decisions now. People still seem to expect corporations to take care of society's problems though, and are outraged when they hear or experience perceived injustices against people or the planet.

People make these shortcomings known by loudly broadcasting personal anecdotes or otherwise untold instances of corporate neglect. This messaging plays an important role in that it serves to effectively communicate each party's expectations. However, I think people get tripped up on thinking any one person should be expected to have a duality of responsibility. When a corporation has to decide whether to plant a few trees or save a few dollars, it first has to look at whether or not planting a few trees might help raise their reputation in the public's eyes and ultimately generate more business, or raise morale within the company and stimulate more productive employees. Of course someone might to make money and separately also want to plant more trees out of a sense of responsilibity, but eventually those goals will conflict, because trees cost money. The question is, then, do we plant more trees or make more dollars? From a corporation's point of view, the answer seems obvious. Thus we have massive oil spills in the Gulf and contaminated water in Flint, and burnt out and angry employees and cheap food that makes us sick, either by affecting our health or to learn how it is produced. However, it is not realistic to expect a corporation to fix these problems without a realignment of the incentive structure.

So where does this leave the individual? For many individuals, they are stuck between a rock and a hard place because they need their job to have a place to live, pay their bills, and put food on the table. Many people don't have the luxury of being able to quit their job or consume ethical products, if an option even exists. Many individuals don't even consider these questions, and when they encounter anti-corporate or antagonistic rhetoric, it can be very disorienting. For many people, the only thing they can do is adjust their expectations.
