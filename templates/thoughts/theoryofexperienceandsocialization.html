Previously knowledge transfer was passed person to person. The internet has increased the frequency and quantity of information available, and has had a cooling effect on the types of interpersonal relationships available. The following can be generalized to any form of primarily one-way mass dissemination of information (namely printed media, radio, and television), but I believe the internet is unique in its impact on knowledge transfer and social networks because the creation and dissemination of knowledge is decentralized. 
</p><p>
With the increasing information load of the internet, more knowledge became available online, but this deadened the transfer of knowledge from person to person as people became more used to the one-directional transfer of knowledge enabled by the internet. In human patterns of organization, this has led to an isolation of the individual as they begin to seek interpersonal experiences/relationships resembling those found online, with a one-directional flow of knowledge transfer. 
</p><p>
In practice, these one-directional kinds of relationships are harder to find and sustain because the agents in an interpersonal relationship are fundamentally different from those in an online relationship. Online, the dissemination of knowledge from a knowledge giver (human) requires no recurring expense of time or effort, only an upfront initial investment to write or otherwise craft and make available the content online. Interpersonally, the investment of time by a knowledge giver is continual and must increase roughly proportionally to the number of relationship with knowledge seekers, in a non-cult scenario. 
</p><p>
For the knowledge seeker, an interpersonal relationship is more beneficial because the information can be personalized to the seeker’s individual situation. The seeker can then provide feedback to the information giver, which establishes a connection and helps them refine the information. Online forms establish a mechanism for providing information feedback online, but the they lack the social benefit, and low latency, of a conversation. To compound the difficulty of incorporating information feedback online, the one-to-many, many-to-one nature of online information dissemination often leads to just problems of scale for the information provider. Artificial intelligence models are a shortcut to provide some form of information feedback incorporation but they have their own drawbacks.
</p><p>
To increase the quality of available information, one could argue for an aggregate approach: all the information people put online can be sucked into a model that transforms and curates the knowledge into a unique form for every individual. I’d argue that this does not improve individual personalization, because information that a model can capture about an individual is limited, and models are likely to suggest information that has already been adopted by others. So in this way the aggregate approach doesn’t actually provide a unique recommendation; the information is the lowest common denominator of whatever is most likely to appeal to a group of individuals. This leads to waves of information propagating across the network of agents once it has been shown to have uptake by a sufficient number of individuals: “going viral”. 
</p><p>
There is an argument that the viral content/information is what people want to see, and that if what they wanted a truly unique experience they would choose otherwise; this is wrong. The aggregate model is based off training data, and it recommends information based on patterns in that data. 
</p><p>
So what can one do with this information? Recognize that the internet is not necessarily an accurate representation of reality, and that interpersonal relationships have a potential richness that may not be visible to you now. Just because it’s not online doesn’t mean it’s not there. Be aware of the nature of one-way relationships and seek meaningful two-way communication in your life. The internet is ultimately an interface to humans, and is only one of many.
