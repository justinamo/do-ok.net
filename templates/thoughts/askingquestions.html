I’ve been asking a lot of questions lately. The point of a question is to pose a juncture between some options, or as an exploratory device. I’ve been thinking about the role of questions in my life and how they affect the relationships I have with the people around me.

What I see the first type of question as is a determination/closure of optionality. By posing a question, you are closing the optionality of the askee on that particular topic from now until the future. By not asking questions, the askee has the advantage of retaining that optionality from now until the future and as we have learned from the discipline of finance, optionality has value. By asking questions you, the asker, can go ahead and resolve that optionality and use that knowledge to determine new frontiers for yourself/the askee.

[tor]Just initially thinking about it, this mindset could be used for accumulation of wealth/power as determined by the value you gain by the askee losing that optionality, but to me this is the capitalist perspective. Instead, this mindset can be used (and I will use) to better the relationships between the asker and askee in the form of more collaboratively determined expectations for all parties. Unity, but in a way where everyone involved has a voice and, one that can sustainably support variety![/tor]

This thought was inspired by a dynamic between me and my late mother’s sister who at the moment to me is the representative for the living-in-Asia side of my family, so to me their opinion is really important. When I have been visiting the past couple christmases she has voiced the opinion that I should marry a Chinese, and she determined that the girlfriend I had at the time was not someone I should make spend their time being with me. Now I have another girlfriend who I really really really like, but who is still not Chinese, so me asking my aunt the question “Do you think I should marry a Chinese person?” is a way to collaboratively set expectations going forward. This erases the optionality she gained by voicing that opinion earlier (the optionality being her ability to choose later whether she likes a girlfriend or not having set the expectation that I should marry a Chinese) but I think will lead to a better outcome for both of us.
