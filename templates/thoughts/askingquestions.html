I’ve been asking a lot of questions lately. The point of a question is to pose a juncture between some options, or as an exploratory device. I’ve been thinking about the role of questions in my life and how they affect the relationships I have with the people around me.

What I see the first type of question as is a determination/closure of optionality. By posing a question, you are closing the optionality of the askee on that particular topic from now until the future. By not asking questions, the askee has the advantage of retaining that optionality from now until the future and as we have learned from the discipline of finance, optionality has value. By asking questions you, the asker, can go ahead and resolve that optionality and use that knowledge to determine new frontiers for yourself/the askee.
